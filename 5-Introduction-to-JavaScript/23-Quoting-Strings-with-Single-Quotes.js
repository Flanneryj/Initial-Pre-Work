/* String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote
This might happen if you want to save a conversation in a string and have the conversation in quotes
 Another use for it would be saving an <a> tag with various attributes in quotes, all within a string
a string has the same kind of quote at the beginning and end. But if you have that same quote somewhere in the middle, the string will stop early and throw an error
