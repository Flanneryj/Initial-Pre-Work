/* String values are immutable, which means that the string cannot be altered once created
This does not mean that String cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed
The only way to change string would be to assign it with a new string

 // Setup
var myStr = "Jello World";

// Only change code below this line

myStr = "Hello World"; // Fix Me
