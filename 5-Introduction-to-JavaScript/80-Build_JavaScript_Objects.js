/* Onjects are similar to arrays but instead of using indexes to access and modify their data
 You access the data in objects through properties
Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects

 // Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "Sable",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everyone"]
