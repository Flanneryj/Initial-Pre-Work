/* Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called
When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters
The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments

 // Example
function ourFunctionWithArgs(a, b) {
  console.log(a - b);
}
ourFunctionWithArgs(10, 5); // Outputs 5

// Only change code below this line.
function functionWithArgs (para1, para2) {
console.log(para1 + para2);
